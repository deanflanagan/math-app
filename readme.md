# Math App
================

A web application built using Django and React that allows users to practice math problems and track their progress.

## How it Works

The application consists of two main components:

### Backend (Django)

The backend is built using Django, a Python web framework. It handles user authentication, stores math questions and user progress in a database, and provides API endpoints for the frontend to interact with.

### Frontend (React)

The frontend is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the application, including a login system, a math question interface, and a progress tracking system.

## Local Development

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (for Django) and `npm install` (for React)
3. Run the backend: `python manage.py runserver`
4. Run the frontend: `npm start`
5. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application

## Testing

The application includes a suite of tests to ensure that it is working correctly. To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Run the backend tests: `python manage.py test`
2. Run the frontend tests: `npm run test`

## Security

The application takes security seriously and includes several features to protect user data:

### Authentication

The application uses Django's built-in authentication system to ensure that only authorized users can access the application.

### Authorization

The application uses Django's built-in permission system to ensure that users can only access features that they are authorized to use.

### Data Encryption

The application uses HTTPS to encrypt data in transit and protect user data from interception.

### Password Hashing

The application uses Django's built-in password hashing system to protect user passwords from unauthorized access.
